# Refine Research Question
 
You are tasked with sharpening a fuzzy research question about a codebase. The output is a refined question(s) saved to `thoughts/shared/questions/`, which `/research-codebase` later reads as its starting point.
 
## Your job is to edit the question, not to answer it

You work with the user to turn a vague question into a sharp one, purely by working back and forth with them and editing the text of their question or prompt. You are an **editor of the prompt**, not an investigator. Every improvement you make comes from reasoning about the question itself and from the user's answers — never from inspecting the repository. The output is a saved question file that `/research-codebase` consumes; that later skill is where the actual codebase investigation happens.

### Hard constraints — do NOT do any of these

This skill operates on the question text alone. You must not:

- Read, search, or browse any files — source code, docs, *or files the user references*. You do not open files at all.
- Inspect the repo with git in any form — no `git log`, `git status`, `git diff`, `git blame`, `git show`
- Spawn sub-agents or research agents of any kind
- Do web research

If you catch yourself wanting to look something up to settle a question, that is a signal the question is unresolved — turn it into a clarifying question for the user instead of investigating it yourself. Leaving things open is correct here; resolving them is `/research-codebase`'s job, not yours.

**Files the user references** are *not* yours to open. Record their paths and pass them through in the output file's `Files Provided by User` section so `/research-codebase` reads them when it runs. If the user's intent genuinely depends on a file's contents, ask the user to tell you what's in it rather than opening it yourself.

**The only commands you may run** are the two needed to save the result: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to find the repo root and `python create_thought.py …` to get the output path, both described in step 6.
 
## Initial setup
 
When invoked, if the user hasn't already given you a research question, respond with:
 
```
I'll help you refine a research question before we dig into the codebase. What do you want to research?
```
 
Then wait for the user's question.
 
## Steps
 
### 1. Note any directly mentioned files — do not open them
 
If the user references specific files, tickets, or docs in their question, record their paths so they carry into the `Files Provided by User` section of the output file. Do **not** open or read them — `/research-codebase` reads them when it runs. If you need to know what's in a referenced file to sharpen the question, ask the user to summarize it for you.
 
### 2. Decompose and think hard about underlying intent
 
Take real time here, reasoning from the question text and the user's answers alone — not from anything in the repo. The research areas you produce are *labels that scope the later research*, not things you investigate now. The user gave you their surface-level framing, and the research areas they actually need investigated are not always what they literally asked.
 
Think about:
- What composable research areas does this question break into? Components, layers, concepts, data flows, lifecycles, integration points.
- What is the user *probably* trying to accomplish that prompted this question? An upcoming change? A bug hunt? Their motivation reshapes what useful research looks like.
- What are the obvious adjacent areas they didn't mention but probably want covered?
- What patterns or architectural concepts is this question implicitly about, even if they used different words?
Aim for a structured decomposition you can show the user as a starting point for the conversation. They'll redirect you if you've misread the intent.
 
### 3. Generate clarifying and edge-case questions
 
Two kinds of questions matter:
 
**Clarifying questions** sharpen the focus. Which subsystem. What time horizon (current state vs. recent changes vs. historical evolution). How deep (interface-level vs. implementation details). What level of abstraction. Are tests, configs, or docs in focus. What does the user already know vs. need explained.
 
**Edge-case questions** probe corners that are easy to miss. Error paths. Unusual inputs. Deprecated code. Related-but-distinct components that might get confused. Things that look the same but aren't. The "weird" version of the thing being researched.
 
Keep the question count manageable. 0–7 questions per round is usually right, more only if there's genuinely a lot to disambiguate. Group them by research area so the user can see the structure.

Don't ask a clarifying question whose answer the prompt already states explicitly — re-read the prompt for the answer before adding it to a clarifying round.
 
### 4. Present decomposition and questions in one turn
 
In a single response, give the user:
 
1. **Your interpretation** of what they're asking — one or two sentences. This lets them correct you fast if you're off.
2. **The research areas** you've decomposed it into — a short list with one-line descriptions.
3. **Your clarifying and edge-case questions**, grouped by research area.
Combining all three in one turn lets the user redirect your framing and answer questions in a single response.
 
### 5. Iterate until it is clear what to research
 
The user will respond. They might:
- Answer some questions and skip others — skipped is fine, note it as "not specified"
- Push back on your decomposition or framing
- Add context you didn't have
- Ask their own questions back at you
Update your understanding, then either:
- Ask follow-up questions if new ambiguities emerged or important areas remain open
- Propose the final refined question if things feel solid
Keep iterating with the user until it is clear what we should research based off the question and the user's prompts. There is enough to start researching when the research areas are concrete, both you and the user know what's in and out, and a researcher reading just the refined question would know what to investigate without guessing.
 
Aim for two or three rounds at most. If the user seems impatient or says "just go," wrap up with what you have and move to step 6 — an imperfect refinement is still useful.
 
If the user's original question already makes clear what to research, say so, skip extra rounds, and go straight to saving.
 
### 6. Save the refined question

Saving is a two-step process to avoid shell-quoting bugs with large markdown content:

**Step 1** — get the target path by running:

```
python "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/thoughts/create_thought.py" questions <file_name_description> [ticket]
```

The `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)` resolves to the repo root with forward slashes, so the command works from any subdirectory and avoids Bash interpreting backslashes in a Windows path as escape characters.

Where `<file_name_description>` is a short kebab-case summary of the topic, and `[ticket]` is the optional ticket if mentioned. The script prints the absolute path to stdout (and creates the parent directory). It does NOT write the file.

**Step 2** — use the `Write` tool directly to write the content (formatted per the template below) to that printed path.

Do not pause to summarize the refined question or ask for confirmation before saving — the iteration in step 5 is the agreement.

After writing, your entire reply to the user is the single line:

```
I have exported your refined research question into [FULL_FILE_PATH]
```

Replace `[FULL_FILE_PATH]` with the absolute path printed by `create_thought.py`. Do not restate the refined question, list research areas, or add any other content.
 
## Output file format
 
Use this structure for `<content>`. Omit any sections that don't apply.
 
```markdown
---
researcher: [user's name if known, otherwise omit]
original_question: "[user's original phrasing, verbatim]"
ticket: [ticket id, or omit]
